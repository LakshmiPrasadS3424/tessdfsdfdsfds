*How to export customer data
    
#How to export customer dataYou can only export files up to 50,000 rows from the Vero UI. If you want to export more data, or data that you can't see how to export in the UI, please email support@getvero.com and we'll do our best to do it for you as quickly as possible.

There are two ways to export data from Vero:

1. 
**You can export a list of contacts (and their properties) that belong to any segment.**
 To do this, select a segment and then hit `Export` in the top right of the screen. The output file includes the email address, ID and all other properties of each contact in CSV format.

2. 
**You can export the results of an email campaign.**
 To do this, visit the `Reports` menu and filter down to the campaign data you want to export. Select `Export` in the top right of the screen.

In both cases, a CSV file will be generated that you can download.
