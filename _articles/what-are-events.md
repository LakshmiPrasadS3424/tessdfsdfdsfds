# What are events?

Vero defines **events** as all the actions a customer is taking on your site. It could be everything from signing up to checking out, viewing a page to clicking a button, etc.. 

Vero lets you collect **event properties** along with any of these events. These are then used to provide more context and customize your email even more.
