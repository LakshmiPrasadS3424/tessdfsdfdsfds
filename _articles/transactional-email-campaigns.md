# What is a transactional campaign?

Transactional campaigns are messages that provide important account or transaction information, such as password resets, receipts or delivery/shipping confirmation.

Transactional campaigns are sent to customers when they trigger a specific event and cannot be unsubscribed from. For this reason, they are **not** marketing campaigns and should be used very carefully. Receipts, invoices and account statements are examples of a transactional campaign. They are communications the customer needs in order to conduct business with you so cannot opt out.

## Transactional emails and push notifications

You can send a transactional campaign as either an email or push notification. Creating a transactional campaign is identical to [behavioral campaign](/articles/what-is-a-behavioral-campaign.html), except for the way unsubscribes are handled by Vero. Workflows are set to behavioral by default, with a tick box option for [creating transactional workflows](/articles/creating-a-new-workflow.html).

## Priority handling of transactional emails 

Transactional emails are prioritised so they are guaranteed immediately delivery. Whilst all campaigns are sent as quickly as possible, there is built in redundancy to ensure customers get mission-critical transactional emails instantly.
