#How do I tell why a triggered (Transactional or Behavioral) email was or was not sent?

Triggered emails are always evaluated for sending when a user performs a specific Event. When you create an automated email you must specify the 'base event' that will triggered the email campaign.

On the Behavioral and Transactional campaign dashboards emails are, by default, grouped based on the event that triggers them.

To view this data on a case by case basis go to `Logs`. You can filter for Customer, Event, Campaign and Type.
