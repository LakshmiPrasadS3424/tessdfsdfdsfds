#Can I integrate Vero with KISSmetrics or Mixpanel

The libraries mentioned here work well, but many customers now choose to use Segment which allows you to install one library and track data to multiple tools, including Vero, KISSmetrics and Mixpanel.

Most customers of Vero use an analytics tool to make solid decisions when it comes to their website and what email marketing campaigns they can automate.

If you use KISSmetrics' or Mixpanel's **Javascript API library** then you can use one of Vero's custom wrappers.

Rather than re-installing all of the Javsacript required to track your contacts' actions on your website using Vero's library, our integrations let you change one piece of code in the `</head>` area of your website, and all of the contacts you `identify` and events you `track` in either KISSmetrics or Mixpanel will also be sent to Vero.

Vero's integrations only work with the KISSmetrics and Mixpanel Javascript APIs, not their backend Ruby, Python, PHP or other libraries.

To find the right code to copy and paste onto your website, head to the integration pages for our [KISSmetrics](https://github.com/getvero/vero-api/blob/master/sections/kissmetrics.md) and [Mixpanel](https://github.com/getvero/vero-api/blob/master/sections/mixpanel.md) integrations on Github.
