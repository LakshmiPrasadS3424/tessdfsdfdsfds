##The basic principle
  In order to segment users and target emails to your customers on an almost one-to-one basis, you need to be able to understand where a user is in your 'funnel' at any given time.
  Vero makes it easy to create email campaigns that target users based on what they've done (e.g. viewed a product) or haven't done (e.g. checked out) as well as segmenting based on user specific variables (e.g. their location) or their past actions (e.g. how many items they've previously purchased) but the basis for all of this is tracking a users actions on your website.
##Tracking user actions
  Tracking events with Vero is relatively straightforward. Using one of our libraries you identify the current user of your site using their email address and call some code to track each action they take. We call each instance of a user completing an action an 'event'.
##Implementing Vero
  We have built a number of libraries to make event tracking as easy as possible for you. Here are the current options. Clicking on a library will take you to the technical implementation guide to help you get up and running:
