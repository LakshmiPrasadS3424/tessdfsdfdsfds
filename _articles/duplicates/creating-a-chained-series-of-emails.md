Vero campaigns are based on 'behaviour'. As described in our 
[Getting Started](https://veroapp.zendesk.com/entries/21931816-installing-vero) guide, this paradigm stems from tracking what your users have or haven't done on your website.
There are many cases where you will want to send a user a series of emails. A simple example is to send a series of three emails to a user after they sign up. Email A is a welcome email, Email B is sent three days after sign up and Email C is sent 10 days after sign up. You also want to ensure that if a user upgrades to a paid plan, they don't receive any of these emails.
Here is how you'd go about creating these emails using Vero:
*Ensure you're tracking when a user 'Signs up' and when a user 'Upgrades to a paid plan'. 
	
*Configure Email A by clicking 'Create new campaign' and targeting users who have signed up but not upgraded to a paid plan. You would set the email to be sent immediately. In behavioural terms you're targeting "A customer who has just signed up".

*Having setup Email A, to setup Email B, you would click 'Create new campaign' and setup the exact same parameters, this time triggering an email three days after the user signs up. In behavioural terms you could think of this campaign as targeting "A customer who hasn't signed up after three days".

*Do the same for Email C, altering the delay to be '10 days'.
You're done!
The benefits of building your campaigns this way are:
i. You can conduct A/B tests of subject lines, from addresses, content and even delivery date easily at each step of the customer's lifecycle.
ii. You can see the results of each campaign clearly.
iii. You can build out much more complex campaigns if you want to. For example, you could setup two emails to be sent three days after a customer signs up, one that goes to customers in Australia and one that goes to customers in the USA.
