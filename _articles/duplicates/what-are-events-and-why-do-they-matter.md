Everything in Vero is event driven. This means your customers actions are the power behind every email you send.
To learn more about this at a high level, check out our Getting Started documentation.
A common question you might be wondering is 
how you can get events to appear in the triggered campaign drop down list, i.e. here:

There are two ways to create an event:
### 1. Via the API
Any time you track a new event via the API it will automatically appear in the dropdown list and can be used across all of the filters.
### 2. Using the 'Create Event' option

You can create an event manually when building a triggered campaign using the  "When a user" drop down menu. Once created this event will be available across all filters. You can also visit the 
[Connect page](http://www.getvero.com/events) and grab the Javascript snippet you need to copy and paste in order to start tracking your events!

## Using dynamic variables with events
When tracking events you can also track custom attributes, or meta-data. An example might be tracking the name, category and image URL of a product a customer views. You can then use these attributes in emails triggered by this event.
Here's an example of the Javascript you might use to track this information:
<script>
_veroq.push(['track', 'viewed product', {name: 'Chocolate Bar', category: 'confectionary', price: 10.50, url: 'http://domain.com/chocolate-bar'}]);
</script>
If you then triggered an email on the 'Viewed product' event, a bit like this:

...then you could use those attributes when crafting the body of your email as follows:

This allows you to send powerful dynamic and even transactional emails, so give it a try!
         
        
          
If it's a quesiton, show the 'was this helpful'
