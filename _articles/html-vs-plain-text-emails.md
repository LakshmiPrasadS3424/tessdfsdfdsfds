When sending emails you can include both a HTML and plain text version of the contents.
By including both versions you leave it up to the user and their email client to decide which format is to be displayed. This helps ensure two things:
*Complete compatibility - certain mobile devices and other, older, email clients prefer plaintext.
	
*User friendliness - leave it up to your customers to turn off HTML formatting if they desire. At least they will still receive the quality emails you are sending!
###Plain text in Vero

To include a plain text version of your email in Vero, simply click the 'Plain Text' tab and copy/paste or type an alternate version of your email.
Remember that plain text emails cannot render HTML so keep any HTML out of the picture!
