#Can I use Sendgrid, Mailgun, Amazon SES, Mandrill or other providers for delivery?

By default, Vero will handle your delivery for you, optimized to ensure your emails reach your users.

Vero also allows you to send your emails via some of your favourite transactional email provider, such as Sendgrid and Mailgun.

To use an alternate provider (and not Vero's default setup), visit `Account > Email Providers` and enter the appropriate credentials.

Here you can currently select three options: Vero's delivery infrastructure, Mailgun or Sendgrid.

Vero currently supports SendGrid and Mailgun. To enable the provider in question, simply select it from the list, enter your API credentials and hit Save and you're good to go.

If you want support for other email providers, please [email us via support](mailto:support@getvero.com).
