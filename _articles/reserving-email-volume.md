# Reserve email volume and save

For most Vero customers, email forms a critical and ongoing part of their customer experience.

Once fully engaged with Vero, many customers have a good idea of how their usage will look six, 12 or even 24 months from now.

We're introducing "reserved plans". These plans enable you to lock in a specific email and subscriber volume for a fixed period. Reserving ahead of time enables us to better plan our resources and provide you with a better experience of Vero. In return for this, you will receive a large saving.

## Our reserve plan pricing

We are introducing three tiers of reserved pricing on our Growth plan ($549/month) or above:

- 6 monthly prepaid, with a discount of 10%
- 12 monthly prepaid, with a discount of 20%
- 24 monthly prepaid, with a discount of 30%

Payments can be made via card of invoice.

To reserve your usage, please email [support@getvero.com]({{site.data.links.email_us}}).

## What happens if I go over the plan I've paid for?

If you exceed the usage you have reserved (either emails or subscribers), you will receive an email letting you know that you have exceeded the limits of the plan you initially reserved. In this instance we will charge you the difference between the new plan and the plan you had already paid for, and will do so on a monthly basis. 

You can, at any time, elect to reserve the larger plan, prepay the difference and receive the same discount as you did when you first elected to reserve your plan.

Imagine you reserve our Growth plan, at $549/month, for 12 months. In this scenario you'd pay $5,270 ($6,588 less a 20% discount) up front. 

After six months, if you were to increase your usage you will move up to the $749/month plan. At this point we would bill you for the difference of $200, monthly. 

## Do you provide refunds if I reserve a plan?

Reserving a plan is designed for those customers that have a well understood idea of their email needs and want to lock in a price, and discount, ahead of time. 

Customers should reserve a plan if they have used Vero for some time and have not experienced large and regular fluctations during the last few months. This is generally a good indicator your needs are fairly stable.

Reserving a plan is a commitment to that plan for the reserved period. We do not provide refunds on reserved payments.

If you are new to Vero or have not yet established an understanding of your usage patterns, we recommend you pay for Vero month-to-month until comfortable that reserving is for you.
