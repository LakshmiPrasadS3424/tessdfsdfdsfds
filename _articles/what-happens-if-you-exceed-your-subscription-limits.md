# What happens if you exceed your subscription limits?

Vero will send you an email when you cross the customer or email thresholds over a month-long period. You will automatically be upgraded to the appropriate plan.

You can downgrade at any time and, if your usage fluctuates, can minimize your spend each and every month.

You can manage your subscriptions in the Vero under **Account > Billing**.
