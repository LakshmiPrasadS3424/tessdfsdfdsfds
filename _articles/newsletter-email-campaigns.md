#What is a newsletter campaign?A 
Newsletter is a one-off email. You  might also call a Newsletter a blast, manual or promotional email.

Newsletters are different to triggered emails because they are manually scheduled for a specific time.

They are considered one-to-many emails, as you are emailing a number of people at once.

In Vero, you define who receives your newsletter using the customer 
Segmentsyou create.

You could, for example, send a weekly email newsletter to everyone in the segment 
**“Blog Subscribers”**
 but not in the segment 
**“Paying Customers”**
 or send a coupon to everyone that is 
not in the segment 
**“Current Customers”**
.

Segments are very powerful and allow you to get very targeted. Thanks to this, it’s easy to send highly personalized 
Newsletters that really resonate with your recipients.
