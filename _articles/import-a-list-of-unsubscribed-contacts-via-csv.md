There are two ways to unsubscribe a list of contacts in Vero:

1. `Copy/Paste`: you can unsubscribe up to 1000 users by copy and pasting their email addresses and checking the `also unsubscribe contacts` box

2. `Import CSV`: If you are importing a significant number of contacts the best way to unsubscribes users is to upload a CSV.

To do this create a CSV with the list of emails you wan to unsubscribe in one column and a second column with the header 
Tags and the word 
unsubscribed in that column.

When you import, all of these customers will be unsubscribed/suppressed forever.

From here you will receive an email notification when the import is successful (or unsuccessful).
