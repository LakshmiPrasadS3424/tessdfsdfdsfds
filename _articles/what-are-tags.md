#What are tags?

Tags are a power way to enhance segmentation.

Most customers do not use tags regularly, but they can be used in a range of different situations.

If you've used other email marketing tools, note that Vero's tags typically hold a different meaning.

The power of tags is that you can manually add tags to individuals via the Vero UI, automatically add tags via our API or add tags in bulk using a CSV upload.

When you create segments, you can filter users based on which tags they have and which they don't. This can let you create preference lists, emulate static lists or use Vero as a lightweight CRM.
