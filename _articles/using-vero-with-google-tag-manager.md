Google Tag Manager is a fantastic product. It also makes it incredibly easy to get going with Vero.
###Step 1
Grab your tag code from 
[getvero.com/connect](https://getvero.zendesk.com/entries/getvero.com/connect). Copy and paste the code in 
[step one](https://getvero.zendesk.com/entries/getvero.com/connect).
###**Step 2**
Head over to Google Tag manager and click 'New Tag'. Configure your options so that it looks like this

###Step 3
Now that our library is setup you need to configure Vero to track your users. In Google Tag Manager, create a new tag that loads on every page. Copy and paste the code from 
[step two of our getting started wizard](http://www.getvero.com/connect?step=2). 
When setting up this code you need to tell us the current logged in customer's email address. The most common way to do this is to use a 'Macro' in Google Tag Manager. You may need your developer's help if they have not already configured a Macro. Here's an example I use:

Once that is configured you can ensure your tag looks like this:

###Step 4
You're virtually setup and good to go! The final step is tracking any user actions that are important to your business. This may take a series of tags, depending what you want to achieve. Here is an example that I have used on an eCommerce site in the past. This tag is loaded on the first page of the checkout and tracks when a customer begins the checkout process! You can grab the example tracking code from 
[step three of the getting started wizard](https://getvero.zendesk.com/entries/getvero.com/connect?step=3).

###Conclusion
And that's it! Now Vero will track your customers, their actions and get you well on your way. To ensure everything is working, check your 
[Event Log](https://getvero.zendesk.com/entries/getvero.com/event_log) - you should be able to see data flowing.
