# What is a project?

Vero projects are isolated environments. You can use them for different sites or products or environments. At Vero, we have a development, a Q&A and a production project.

Projects can be set to the following statuses:

-   **Live:** Emails will be sent to customers 
-   **Test:** Emails will be sent to a single email address for testing
-   **Offline:** Emails will not be sent

**Note:** You can copy data from one project to another.
