It’s just that simple.

The truth is that unless you’ve already laid a strong marketing foundation with lifecycle emails that nudge your users and customers at just the right moment, you aren’t yet at the point where you need to worry about the fine details.

But aren’t subject lines and design important?

Yes, of course. But the subject line isn’t be the deciding factor when


a recipient makes the split-second choice to open your email or put it in the trash. There’s just so much more to it.

For example:

*Do they understand why they received this email?


*Have you done a good job guiding them through your buying process so that this email is the very last touch point in comprehensive, educational marketing strategy?


*Did their behavior result in this message, or is everyone hearing the same spiel?

If you want to build trust with your customers, users, readers and leads, these are the questions you need to be asking about 
[email marketing](https://www.getvero.com/). And trust is what gets emails opened, not subject lines.

##It’s Time to Think Bigger About Email


My hope is that as you read through this guide, a light bulb will go off in your brain.

“There’s so much untapped potential in email.”

Lifecycle email is a massive opportunity. It can help you accomplish nearly any marketing goal: increase engagement, sell more products, onboard new users, bring back inactive ones and, most importantly, earn trust.

What you’ll find as you begin to implement these emails is that people actually want them. A timely, contextual lifecycle email is a welcome presence in the inbox. Instead of begging for attention, your message arrives just as the recipient is trying to decide what to do next.

It’s powerful and it can be a bit overwhelming. This guide aims to fix that. With 135 examples broken down into five categories and 41 sub-categories, it contains all the inspiration you need to get started.

I hope you enjoy it. And if you want to save these examples in your own personal swipe file, just sign up for our newsletter and we’ll email you a .zip file containing all the emails in this guide (see below).
