*How Vero’s conversion tracking works
    
#How Vero’s conversion tracking worksVero tracks what customers do on your website after 
opening or 
clicking one of your email campaigns.

To define a conversion action, simply select one of the actions you are tracking on your website as part of the campaign creation process. For example, as part of creating a newsletter, you select the conversion action like so:

Once setup, Vero will start tracking your conversions. Vero tracks three different types of conversions:

– 
**Direct conversion**
: these are tracked when a contact clicks on one of your emails, returns to your site and takes an action in the 
same session. Right now this is only supported for customers using our Javascript snippet.


– 
**View-through conversions**
: these are tracked when a contact opens a campaign and ultimately returns to your site to complete the conversion action. In this instance, we track the conversion if it is within a 
conversion window, e.g. 30 days, and assign the conversion to the campaign most recently opened by the contact.


– 
**Indirect conversions**
: these are tracked when a contact receives a campaign and later takes the conversion action on your website. In this instance, we track the conversion if it is within a 
conversion window, e.g. 30 days, and assign the conversion to the campaign most recently received by the contact. Indirect conversions are useful for use with our negative variations only, so Vero can track the actions of contacts that never even receive a particular campaign.

You can customise the conversion window used to track view-through conversions under the `Account > Advanced` menu item. By default, this is set to 30.
