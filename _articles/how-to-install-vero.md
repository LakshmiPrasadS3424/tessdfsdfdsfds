# How to install Vero

There are two key steps to getting setup with Vero:

1. Tracking who your contacts are and what they are doing, and
2. Writing at least one campaign (we recommend a triggered campaign for maximum understanding of Vero

## Plug and play solutions

Two ways you can quickly get data into Vero include [Segment]({{site.data.links['segment']}}) and [Zapier]({{site.data.links['zapier']}}) (in beta, please [email us]({{site.data.links['email_us']}}) for instant access).

If you’re already setup on these platforms you’ll find them a quick way to get going, without installing Vero’s API directly (see below).

## Installing Vero on your site or in your app

To get the most value out of Vero you should install our API and track what your customers do on your website or in your application.


For best results, involve your developer
You need some basic knowledge of HTML to get going with Vero. To get going the fastest, shoot this document to your developer (or shoot us an email at support@getvero.com).

## Our API has two key functions:

1. Tracking a contact (user/customer/subscriber). We call this function identifying a user, and
2. Tracking what actions a contact takes. Actions are defined by you and typical examples would be things like Views a product, Begins checkout, Uses a feature, Logs in, Subscribes to blog, etc.

Installing our API is most easily done using our [Javascript library]({{site.data.links['vero_api']}}).

## Supported libraries

You can use Vero’s API with any coding language, but we currently have wrappers for these languages:

- Ruby
- Python
- PHP
- Perl
- iOS

We also have documentation on using the raw API end-points via cURL or similar.

## Setting up your first campaign

To get the most value out of Vero you should setup a triggered campaign. These are automated emails that are triggered when a customer takes a certain action, so they work whilst you sleep.

There are three types of emails you can send in Vero:

Behavioral emails
Newsletters
Transactional emails
