#How to setup my domain signing and remove ‘via getveromail.com’ from your emailsBy default, Vero will send your emails using our own IP addresses and domain configuration.

For many customers, this is totally fine, but you may want to send emails from your own domain instead.

The key benefits of this are: better deliverability, links and images are masked with your own domain and Vero is truly invisible to your customers.

###How your emails look by default


When you first sign up to Vero, your emails will look something like this:

[![via-getvero](https://www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/via-getvero.png)](https://www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/via-getvero.png)

Email clients will show this because the domain you send from (
test@chrishexton.com in the example above) does not match the sending domain, 
getvero.com.

MULTIPLE FROM DOMAINS
You might see 'via getveromail.com' or another domain as we use multiple domains to ensure maximum deliverability for all our customers.

By setting up your Vero DNS records your recipients will no longer see the ‘via’ message.

###Request your DNS records by adding your Domain


To find the DNS records you need to confirm your domain at `Account > Configuration > Email delivery`.

You will then need to set these DNS records up on your domain.Â To do this, you’ll need to look at the how-to for your specific web host. Googling 
[Setup DNS records](https://www.google.com.au/search?q=how+to+configure+dns+records&oq=how+to+configure+dns+records) is the fastest way to find your providers instructions.

CUSTOM CNAME
By default we provide a CNAME record for email.yourdomain.com. This CNAME is used to track links. If you already have a CNAME setup on this subdomain, please email support@getvero.com and we can adjust the subdomain to something that works for you.

###Verify your records


Once you have added the DNS records to your domain, return to your Vero Account. You will see the 
Verify DNS Records button.

When you click this button Vero will check to confirm that the DNS records are set up correctly and, if so, it will start sending your emails with this configuration going forward.

From now on you will no longer see the 'via' message in your outgoing emails!
