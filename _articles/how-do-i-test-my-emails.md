#How do I 'test' my emails?

To test your email campaigns' style and formatting before you send them, use Vero's Preview functions.

There are two ways to preview an email:

1. Browser preview. If you are on a campaign dashboard or actively creating/editing a campaign you can preview a copy of the email in a new browser tab. If you are on the campaign dashboard, select `Preview – browser` from the drop down menu associated with the campaign. This will open a new tab in your browser with a copy of the. On this screen you can select the Variation you want to preview as well as a particular contact whose details you would like to see populated in the email. If you are editing a campaign, simply select the `Preview` button next to the WYSIWYG editor to open the same window.

An example of the browser preview is below:

2. Email preview. On the campaign dashboard you can also select `Preview – email` to have a copy of the email sent to your own inbox. After selecting this preview option you can choose which Variation and contact to use when rendering the email as well as define a single or multiple recipients for the preview. The three most recent addresses you used to preview a campaign are available for you to select via a quick checkbox.
