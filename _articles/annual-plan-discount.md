# Annual plan discount

For most Vero customers, email forms a critical and ongoing part of their customer experience.

Many customers have a good idea of how their email usage will look six, 12 or even 24 months from now.

On our self-service plans, you can elect to pay upfront yearly and, in exchange, receive a 15% discount on Vero's standard prices. By committing to a specific email and subscriber volume for a fixed period, you help us better plan our resources. 

This in turn means we can provide you with a better experience – both technically and in terms of support. In return for this, we're happy to provide a saving.

## What happens if I go over the volume I've locked in?

If you exceed the usage on your annual plan and need to move to a higher tier (because you have exceeded the subscriber limit on your plan) we will email you to let you know. We will then charge you the difference between the new monthly plan and the plan you have already paid for, doing so on a monthly basis by default.

Imagine you lock in our $125/month plan, for 12 months. In this scenario you'd pay $1,275 up front ($225 less a 15% discount). Imagine that, six months later, you've increased your usage and need move up to the $199/month plan. In this scenario we will begin billing you the _difference_ between the $125/month and $199/month plans, **on a monthly basis**. In this example, that would be $74.

**Note:** excess usage is paid monthly, unless otherwise agreed. If you don't want to pay monthly you can of course elect to lock in the pricing on the new annual plan. In this scenario you will receive the same discount you did when you first locked in your pricing.

## Do you provide refunds if I pay annually?

Annual plans are typically non-refundable in line with the terms outlined in our [Terms of Service](https://www.getvero.com/terms-of-service).

Paying annually is designed for those customers that have a solid understanding of their email needs and want to lock in a set price for the year (or get a discount).

We recommend that customers only pay annually if they are confident in their plans for the next year.
