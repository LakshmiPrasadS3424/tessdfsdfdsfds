# Annual plan - save 15%

Email and push messages will likely form a critical and ongoing part of your customer experience. And, if like many customers, you have a good idea of how your subscriber numbers will look 6, 12 or even 24 months from now, you can choose an annual plan and save 15%.

## What happens if I exceed the subscriber limit on my plan?
If you exceed the subscriber limit on your annual plan, we’ll send you an email to let you know that you’ll be upgraded to the next pricing tier. We will then charge you the difference between the new monthly plan and the plan you have already paid for. This payment will be taken on a monthly basis, by default.

For example, if you select the $125/month plan for 12 months you would pay $1,275 upfront ($225 less  15% discount). Six months later, you've increased your subscriber numbers (nice one!) and you need to move up to the $199/month plan. In this scenario, we would begin billing you $74 (the difference between the $125/month and $199/month plans), **on a monthly basis**. 

If you’d like to upgrade to a new annual plan and receive 15% discount, you can [email support](mailto:support@getvero.com) and they can upgrade your account.


## Do you offer refunds on annual plans?

Annual plans are typically non-refundable in line with our [Terms of Service](https://www.getvero.com/terms-of-service).
