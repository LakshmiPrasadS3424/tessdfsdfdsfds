#Can I use other Email Service Providers (ESP's) for delivery?

By default, Vero will handle your delivery for you, optimized to ensure your emails reach your users.

Vero also allows you to send your emails via some of your favourite transactional email providers, such as Sendgrid and Mandrill.

To use an alternate provider (and not Vero's default setup), visit *Settings > Email Delivery* and enter the appropriate credentials.

Here you can currently select five options: Vero's delivery infrastructure, Mailgun, Sendgrid, Mandrill and DynDNS.

To enable the provider in question, simply select it from the list, enter your API credentials and hit **Save** and you're good to go.
