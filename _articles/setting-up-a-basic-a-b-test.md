##Basic A/B variation test
    
One of the core benefits of Vero is being able to quickly and easily test and refine hypotheses.Â 
Configuring your first A/B test is a simple process. The following steps should guide you through each step.

###**1. Adding a variation**
Having defined your targeting settings and your first variation (known as Variation A) you can choose to add multiple variations. Ensure you have 'Saved' the first variation and you will see the following option appear:

Click 'Add' to begin working on your new variation.

###**2. Editing a variation**
Each variation can have a separate from, subject, content and HTML template. You are free to mix and match these as you wish. Our advice is, generally, to test a single hypothesis with each variation. You can switch between variations using the following tabs:

###**3. Variation rules**
Variations are sent out in a 1,2,3 pattern with each variation receiving a equal split of sends. At this point in time you should ensure you have a conversion event configured so you can meaningfully track which variation is the most successful. You should then remove other variations from the sending cycle.
This allows you to rapidly test new ideas and determine a winner.

###**4. Reporting on a variation**
Results are reported individually for each variation. The following screenshot shows you what you can expect on the results page. This overview allows you to see the effectiveness of a variation in terms of its open, click and conversion rates. You can also determine any negativity surrounding a variation by monitoring unsubscribes attributed to it specifically.

That's it! Those are the four basic steps to getting up and running with A/B testing.
