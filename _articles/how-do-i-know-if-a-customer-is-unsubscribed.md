# How do I know if a customer is unsubscribed?

When a customer is unsubscribed their profile and history will remain stored in Vero, however they will no longer receive any marketing emails.

To check whether a customer is unsubscribed, visit their profile page. A yellow bar at the top of the profile page indicates that the contact is unsubscribed:

![{{ site.data.screenshots.vero.customer.unsubscribed.title }}]({{ site.data.screenshots.vero.customer.unsubscribed.image }})
