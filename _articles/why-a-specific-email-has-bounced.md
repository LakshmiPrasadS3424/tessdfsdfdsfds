# Why has a specific email has bounced?

When an email bounces, Vero records the details as part of the Logs, including the SMTP error returned by the recipients ISP/ESP, the number of times Vero attempted delivery and when this occurred.

To see this data, select an email in the logs and choose *View email data* from the options dropdown. An example is below:

![{{ site.data.screenshots.vero.email-logs-bounce['title'] }}]({{ site.data.screenshots.vero.email-logs-bounce['image'] }})

You can then view a more detailed reason for the error [here](http://www.serversmtp.com/en/smtp-error). SMTP error documentation is widely available online and there a many forums for digging into errors.
