# Reporting on all campaigns

When you navigate to **Reports** you'll be directed to an overview that defaults to display statistics for **All Campaigns** within a custom date range. 

This overview will comprise two reports:

## 1. Engagement

You can track total send volume of your entire project over time and compare movements in customer engagement.

Three different views will be displayed:

* **Overview:** a summary of email engagement for all your campaigns within the selected date range
  ![{{ site.data.screenshots.vero.reporting.overview-engagement['title'] }}]({{ site.data.screenshots.vero.reporting.overview-engagement['image'] }})
* **Graph:** to visualise daily email engagement and map trends
  ![{{ site.data.screenshots.vero.reporting.chart['title'] }}]({{ site.data.screenshots.vero.reporting.chart['image'] }})
* **Historical breakdown:** to review daily email engagement 
  ![{{ site.data.screenshots.vero.reporting.breakdown['title'] }}]({{ site.data.screenshots.vero.reporting.breakdown['image'] }})

## 2. Recent Campaigns

You can compare the email performance of your five most recent newsletters sent.

![{{ site.data.screenshots.vero.reporting.recent['title'] }}]({{ site.data.screenshots.vero.reporting.recent['image'] }})
