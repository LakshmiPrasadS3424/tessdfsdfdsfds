# Troubleshooting Reports

## My campaign results don't seem right

If your campaign metrics do not appear to be correct here are some things to consider:

- Delivered: Emails can sometimes take some time to be accepted by the ISP. This means that your delivered metric can not update until we receive confirmation.
- Opened: Opens are tracked by a small pixel inserted into the email. This can only be recorded if the customer has images enabled in their email account.
