*What is a behavioral campaign?
    
#What is a behavioral campaign?Behavioral email campaigns are marketing emails that are automatically sent to customers when they take certain actions on your site or in your mobile application. You can send an email immediately or set a wait period, such as a few days.

In Vero, behavioral emails are used to send highly personalized emails based on current and past user behaviour. Here are a few examples:

*Send new subscribers a series of welcome emails.


*Send a coupon code when a customer views a product page three times in one week but doesn’t make a purchase.


*Remind your users about app features they haven’t tried yet.

Behavioural emails can also be used to power drip campaigns and autoresponders (i.e a series of automated emails) as an action on your website can trigger both a single email or a series.
