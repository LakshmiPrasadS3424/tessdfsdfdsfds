*A/B variation testing emails
    
#A/B variation testing emailsIn Vero you can A/B test all of your email campaigns: 
Newsletters, Transactionalemails and
Behaviouralemails
.

##Overview


You can A/B test:

*Subject lines


*From addresses


*Body content


*Templates

You are also able to select the split rate for each variation.

When running an A/B test on a 
Behavioral or 
Transactionalemail campaign that has more than one email (a series campaign), A/B tests 
**run across the entire series**
. The split is decided with the first email in the series and the remaining emails follow suit.

For example, if a customer receives 
Variation B for the first email, they will receive Variation B throughout. This allows you to test entirely different templates or from addresses without your customers getting conflicting and inconsistent messages.

Please note, newsletter and behavioral/transactional A/B testing are accessed in slightly different ways.

*After selecting “New A/B Test” you’ll have the options of “Add Negative Variation” and “Add Variation.” A negative variation is a hold-out control group. The people that “receive this campaign” will actually not be sent to. Add variation is straightforward, you can add multiple variations if you’d like.
