##How to import a HTML template
To import a HTML template, simply click on the 'Templates' option on the left hand menu. From there you can select a HTML template to import. There are no restrictions on the sorts of layout options you can use: heading, table, div, paragraph, image, link, etc. tags are all valid.
##Defining a template's content
Templates are meant to be used as just that, a template. When creating a campaign you can select which base template you'd like to use and customise it's content for that campaign.
In order to define which areas of your master template are customisable, you simply add the CSS class 'vero-editable' to any element who's content you want to define. It is important to note, that you will be unable to edit this element unless you have some default content.
**Note:**
 Bear in mind that when defining content as part of campaign creation, you will also be able to use basic HTML within an editable area (such as bold, italics, underlining, bullets and link tags).
##Working with images
At this time you can not upload images when defining content as part of creating a campaign. You have to host the images on your own domain / server (we recommend Amazon S3).
**Note:**
 You can manually change the HTML to link to a new image as long as it's parent element has the class 'vero-editable', you simply cannot upload images just yet.
##Importing templates from other platform
At this time we do not have an automatic import for templates used with Campaign Monitor, Mailchimp or other hosted email platforms. Although this is part of our roadmap, currently you will have to adjust some elements of your templates before uploading.
To use a template effectively, simply edit it and remove any 
proprietary tags or classes from the template you have used on your hosted email platform. This will ensure that it works cross-platform and looks beautiful when used with Vero!
