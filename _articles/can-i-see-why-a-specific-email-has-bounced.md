#Can I see why a specific email has bounced?When an email bounces, Vero records the details as part of the 
Logs, including the SMTP error returned by the recipients ISP/ESP, the number of times Vero attempted delivery and when this occurred.

To see this data, select an email in the logs and choose `View email data` from the options dropdown. An example is below:
