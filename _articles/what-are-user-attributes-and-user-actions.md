#What are properties and events?

Contacts have Properties. Examples include their first name, last name, age, location and lifetime value. Typically, you collect this data when users sign up on your website or fill out surveys and forms. This data is really useful for segmentation, so Vero makes it easy to capture any custom properties that you want to.

Contacts trigger Events. Events are simply actions contacts take, they are the things that your contacts do . Examples include Signs up, Checks out, Views a product, Subscribes to the blog and so on – they’re the things individual contacts do on your website or in your application. Usually you collect this data as contacts browse your site and use it’s features. You can capture as many actions as you want for each customer using our API.
