# Organising and tagging email campaigns

Vero's [Campaigns](https://app.getvero.com/campaigns) menu allows you to manage the campaigns you are sending to your customers.

##Campaign types

Vero's email campaigns are grouped into three primary groups:

***Transactional** – these are emails that must be sent to your customers each time they take an action. For example, receipts, notifications and password reset emails. These emails 
ignore unsubscribe notifications.


***Behavioral** – these are marketing emails triggered by user activity or inactivity.


***Newsletters** – these are one-off emails sent at a scheduled time to a segment, or number of segments, of your customers.

You can quickly filter between campaign types using the tabs at the top of the campaigns page:

##Organising campaigns with tags

You can group campaigns together using tags. A tag is essentially a 'category', and a campaign can have many tags at once.

If you had a group of campaigns helping users get onboarded with your product, you might add a tag called 'onboarding' to each of these campaigns, as follows:

You can then filter to only see these campaigns using the filter menu:

##Filtering your campaigns

Aside from tags there are a number of other filters available to help you find the campaign(s) you need quickly.

***Keyword** – this allows you to quickly and dynamically search for a campaign by name. The search is fast, so you can quickly try and remember that pesky campaign name!


***Status** – this allows you to filter campaigns via their current status: whether they are in draft mode, are launched and live or are paused.


***Date** – this allows you to filter the numbers you see for the campaigns on screen. You can view the open, click, and conversion rates for a specific time period. If you leave these unset, we show you the entire history of a campaign, by default.

These filters should help you manage and navigate your campaigns quickly and easily.
