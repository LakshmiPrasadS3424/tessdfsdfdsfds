# Import a list of unsubscribed customers via CSV

To learn the full process to import customers via CSV, read [Import a list of customers via CSV](/articles/import-a-list-of-customers-via-csv.html).

There are two ways to unsubscribe a list of customers in Vero:

## Copy/Paste a list

You can unsubscribe up to 1000 customers by copy and pasting their email addresses and checking the *also unsubscribe customers* box at the bottom.

![{{site.data.screenshots.vero.csv-paste['title']}}]({{site.data.screenshots.vero.csv-paste.image}})

## Import a CSV

If you are importing a significant number of customers the best way to unsubscribes them is to upload a CSV.

To do this create a CSV with the list of emails you want to unsubscribe in one column and a second column with the header Tags and the word `unsubscribed` in that column.

When you import, all of these customers will be marked as unsubscribed.

![{{site.data.screenshots.vero.csv-import['title']}}]({{site.data.screenshots.vero.csv-import.image}})

From here you will receive an email notification when the import is successful (or unsuccessful).
