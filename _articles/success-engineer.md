#Software Engineer, Growth
 

###Location: San Francisco, California


At Vero, we’re a small but efficient team. We believe in execution and automation.

Technology touches every part of Vero. We sell a technical product to sophisticated, educated customers that value email marketing and personalisation.

In this role we’re looking for someone to join our team in San Francisco that has a go-get attitude and can do three things:

*Work with our customer success team on challenging issues and own the bridge to the Product Team, helping surface and fix recurring issues.


*Own our marketing website and blog and work with Chris, our CEO, to run and execute marketing tests and ideas with speed.


*Work with Damien, our Product Manager, and Chris to run experiments over our onboarding workflow.

At Vero, we keep it simple: if we can’t get our customers installed and sending great emails, they will not be happy, nor will we.

**About you**

You’ve been hacking on projects for years. You’re probably a self-taught developer. You’ve got skills and you’re proud of them. You’re dangerous because you move quickly.

You can’t sleep at night whilst a customer is waiting on something you know you can deliver. You like taking ownership of challenging tasks and can’t stand when you haven’t executed on them. You write lists. You check them off.

You are efficient, and you care about ensuring those you work with have a phenomenal experience. You enjoy obsessing over the details. Details maketh the product!

**The work you’ll do**

You’ll work with new customers to ensure they have 
**the best possible experience**
 using Vero. We preach that great marketing is about phenomenal customer experience and you’re going to provide the technical leverage to make this happen at Vero.

You’ll work directly on our marketing experiments and analytics to help improve Vero, our product and our blog faster. You’ll be expected to lead marketing ideas and experiments from ideation to successful completion, analysis and reflection (to adjust and improve for the next project).

You can build tools in Ember.js, PHP, Ruby and are game to try any language. You believe you can learn what you need to to accomplish a task. You’re nimble with code and quick with an efficient solution. You don’t know the words “
I can’t figure this out” and Google is your best friend.

You’ll get valuable product feedback and work with the product team to make this a reality. You’ll code some of the solutions yourself.

You’re the most valuable member of our support team: nailing any problem thrown at you by a customer and building repeatable solutions by creating internal tools and helping the product team find and fix core bugs.

You’ll be given freedom to work on the solutions that you think will make Vero a better product and a better company.

**Skills you need**

*HTML, CSS, Javascript experience. WordPress a bonus. Preferably 2+ years.


*Ruby, Python, PHP or Perl development experience. Preferably 2+ years.


*Experience with marketing tools like Optimizely, Google Analytics, and so on.


*Experience with MySQL, PostgreSQL or other SQL technologies.

**Our tech stack**

At Vero we use the best tool for each job. Therefore, we use a wide-range of interesting and exciting technologies. Here are some we use right now:

*WordPress


*Ruby and Rails


*Ember.js


*PostgreSQL


*Redis


*ElasticSearch


*Redshift


*Cassandra
