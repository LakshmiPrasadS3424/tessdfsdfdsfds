# What are customer properties?

Customer properties are attributes that are attached as data to a user. A customer can have **multiple properties**. 

Vero has reserved properties such as `first name`, `last name`, `age`, etc... 

You often get this data when a customer signs up to your site, fills out a survey or passes an order. These properties are key in Vero and let you segment your customer base with granularity.
