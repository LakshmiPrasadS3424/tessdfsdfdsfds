When you are create a 
[Segment](https://www.getvero.com/segments) with Vero and want to segment based on dates, for example:

...you should record dates as properties in the format:
YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS-HH:MM
This follows the ISO 8601 format, 
[as outlined here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601#Combined_date_and_time_representations).
