###**1. Capturing email addresses**
 
People are going to sign up for your educational drip campaign on your home page or another landing page. To do this, you’ll need a form they can enter their details in.
Rather than storing customers in 'lists' Vero stores every action your users make. This gives you more control over the campaigns you can setup.
To capture someone’s email with Vero you can simply need to insert a form that submits to ‘
[https://getvero.com/forms](https://getvero.com/forms)’. The form must have at least an email and title field (you can add any other field you want as well). When someone fills out the form the action will be recorded against their profile so you can use it to trigger a campaign later (point two).
Here’s an example form you can copy. For more details, check out our 
[full article on subscribing users via a web form](https://getvero.zendesk.com/entries/22519391-creating-a-subscribe-form).
<form https://www.getvero.com/forms" style="margin: 0px; color: rgb(26, 102, 144); cursor: pointer; ">
https://www.getvero.com/forms" >
 <input id='api_key' > 
 <input /> <input id="title" >
<input id="email" >
<input id="submit" >
</form>
Here’s what it’ll look like in Vero when someone submits the form. As you can see it’s recorded that chris@getvero ‘Submitted the form’. We can then use this action, along with the finer details, to setup drip campaigns in a snap.

###**2. Setting up the emails**
Now that you’re capturing users’ email addresses you can easily configure a series of drip emails. 
Simply create a new campaign via the 
[Vero dashboard](http://getvero.com/events) and configure the parameters to something like the following:

This campaign will be sent to users at 10am the day after they submit your form. You can then easily setup multiple campaigns that go out on days 4, 8, 10, etc. to form a chain of drip emails.
###**3. Tracking results**
One of the things we’ve tried to do with Vero is make it super easy to track 
**actual conversions**
.
By simply defining a conversion event, in this case ‘Signed up’ we can tell how many people are responding to our drip email campaign and actually signing up to Vero.

Here's a screenshot to give you an idea of just how easy it is to see the **true**
 effectiveness of any campaign you send. This sort of tracking is really powerful and means you can get started straight away without spending hours configuring analytics software!
