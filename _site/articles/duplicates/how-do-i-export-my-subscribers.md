To export your subscribers you should visit the 'Customers' page: 
[https://app.getvero.com/people](https://app.getvero.com/people)
At the top right of this page there are a series of actions, such as importing and exporting to CSV.
Select 
**Export to CSV**

An export will begin. It can take a few minutes depending on the size of your database. Once ready the downloaded CSV file will include all customer data, including custom attributes.
**Note:**
 If you have over 50,000 customers in your database please 
[let us know](http://mailto:support@getvero.com) about your export as the tool can be slow at these volumes. We're happy to help!
